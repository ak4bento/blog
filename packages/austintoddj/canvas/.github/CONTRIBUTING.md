# Contributing Guide

Hi! I'm really excited that you are interested in contributing to Canvas. The following guide will help you get
 your environment set up to begin making changes.

## Before you get started

- Make sure the [Vue DevTools](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/vuejs-devtools/nhdogjmejiglipccpnnnanhbledajbpd?hl=en) extension is installed in your Chrome browser
- Add the following function from [Caleb Porzio](https://calebporzio.com/bash-alias-composer-link-use-local-folders-as-composer-dependancies/) to your `~/.bashrc`, `~/.bash_profile` or `~/.zshrc`:

```bash
composer-link() {composer config repositories.local '{"type": "path", "url": "'$1'"}' --file composer.json}
```

## Setup

You can open a completely prebuilt, ready-to-code development environment using Gitpod.

[![Open in Gitpod](https://gitpod.io/button/open-in-gitpod.svg)](https://gitpod.io/#https://github.com/austintoddj/canvas/tree/master)

Alternatively, see instructions below to manually setting up an environment on your own machine.

### Git

Fork the project on [https://github.com/austintoddj/canvas](https://github.com/austintoddj/canvas) to your own account. Then clone the fork with the following command:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-account/canvas.git
```

In an adjacent directory from where you cloned the repo, create a new Laravel project with the following command:

```bash
composer create-project --prefer-dist laravel/laravel blog
```

### Database

The fastest way to get a database up and running is to issue the following command:

```bash
touch database/database.sqlite
```

Now update your `.env` file to reflect the new database:

```php
DB_CONNECTION=sqlite
```

### Directories

From your Laravel app, link the local version of Canvas using the `composer-link()` function:

```bash
composer-link ../canvas/
composer require austintoddj/canvas @dev
```

### Installation

Now that the projects are linked, run the following installation steps:

```bash
# Install the Canvas package
php artisan canvas:install

# Link the storage directory
php artisan storage:link
```

Statistics are a core component to the app, so it's best to have a large dataset in place when developing. To
 generate some, add the following factories to your Laravel app:

```php
<?php

namespace Database\Factories;

use Illuminate\Database\Eloquent\Factories\Factory;

class CanvasVisitFactory extends Factory
{
    /**
     * The name of the factory's corresponding model.
     *
     * @var string
     */
    protected $model = \Canvas\Models\Visit::class;

    /**
     * Define the model's default state.
     *
     * @return array
     */
    public function definition()
    {
        return [
            'post_id' => \Canvas\Models\Post::all()->pluck('id')->random(),
            'ip' => $this->faker->ipv4,
            'agent' => $this->faker->userAgent,
            'referer' => $this->faker->url,
            'created_at' => today()->subDays(rand(0, 60))->toDateTimeString(),
            'updated_at' => today()->subDays(rand(0, 60))->toDateTimeString(),
        ];
    }
}
```

```php
<?php

namespace Database\Factories;

use Illuminate\Database\Eloquent\Factories\Factory;

class CanvasViewFactory extends Factory
{
    /**
     * The name of the factory's corresponding model.
     *
     * @var string
     */
    protected $model = \Canvas\Models\View::class;

    /**
     * Define the model's default state.
     *
     * @return array
     */
    public function definition()
    {
        return [
            'post_id' => \Canvas\Models\Post::all()->pluck('id')->random(),
            'ip' => $this->faker->ipv4,
            'agent' => $this->faker->userAgent,
            'referer' => $this->faker->url,
            'created_at' => today()->subDays(rand(0, 60))->toDateTimeString(),
            'updated_at' => today()->subDays(rand(0, 60))->toDateTimeString(),
        ];
    }
}

```

In the `run()` method of the `DatabaseSeeder`:

```php
\Database\Factories\CanvasViewFactory::new()->count(850)->create();
\Database\Factories\CanvasVisitFactory::new()->count(500)->create();
```

You can now run `php artisan db:seed` and you will have a substantial amount of views for each post.

### Developing

Instead of making and compiling frontend changes in the package, then having to re-publish the assets in the
 Laravel app again and again, we can utilize a symlink: 

```bash
# remove the existing assets from the Laravel app
rm -rf public/vendor/canvas/*

# go inside the empty directory and create a symlink
cd public/vendor/canvas
ln -s ../../../../canvas/public/* .
```

Once you've made your changes, [create a pull request](https://github.com/austintoddj/canvas/compare) from your fork to the `develop` branch of the project repository.
