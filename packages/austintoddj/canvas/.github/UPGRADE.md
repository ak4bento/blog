## Upgrading to 6.0.0 from 5.4

> **Important:** With the release of Laravel 8 and the introduction of the legacy-factories package, Canvas _no longer
> supports_ PHP <= 7.2. It does however continue to support Laravel 6/7/8 and PHP >= 7.3

### Database (Export)

The `canvas_user_meta` table has been removed in v6.0.0, and a new table: `canvas_users` will take its place. Canvas
 will no longer rely on the default `users` table, or allow you to specify your own user model. This shift mimics the
 underlying structure of WordPress and similar apps. 

> Note: The process for migrating data will be unique based on your choice of IDE and database.

The first step is to export all data in Canvas-related tables to a SQL dump. The important part of this step is to make
 sure your export does **not include** the table structure. You only want INSERT statements in the actual export
 . *If you do include CREATE TABLE statements, it'll modify the new tables when importing later*.

For instance, I use [Sequel Pro](http://sequelpro.com/). When I exported my data, I made sure to un-check the
 Structure and DROP TABLE syntax elements in the export selection screen.

The following tables need to be included in the export:

- `canvas_posts`
- `canvas_posts_tags`
- `canvas_posts_topics`
- `canvas_tags`
- `canvas_topics`
- `canvas_views`
- `canvas_visits`

Once completed, you can drop those tables from your database.

> Optional: If you want to keep the `migrations` table as minimal as possible, you may delete all references to
> `_canvas` records.

### Updating dependencies

Update your `austintoddj/canvas` dependency to `^6.0` in your `composer.json` file. Upgrade the package to the latest
 version:

```bash
composer update
```

### Migrations

Run the new migrations using the `canvas:migrate` Artisan command:

```bash
php artisan canvas:migrate
```

### Database (Import)

You may now import the SQL dump that you created above into your database. Remember, your database and IDE will
 determine if you should run into any errors while performing this action.
 
Once the import is complete, the `user_id` column in the following tables will need to be addressed:

- `canvas_posts`
- `canvas_tags`
- `canvas_topics`
 
Since those values reflect the user ID from the default `users` table, you'll need to make sure you manually update
 those to the correct user IDs when you have them established in `canvas_users`.
 
### Setting up a user

Since we don't rely on the default `users` table anymore, you'll need create your first user for Canvas. It's really
 simple, just run the following Artisan command:
 
```bash
php artisan canvas:user admin --email {email} 
```

That's it! You should jump in right away and update your credentials. Now that you've given yourself Admin access
, you can create new users from the UI. However, the `canvas:user` Artisan command is a handy little tool for
 creating users on the fly. You can specify more options like this:
 
```bash
// Somebody who can write and manage their own posts but cannot publish them
php artisan canvas:user contributor --email {email}

// Somebody who can publish and manage posts including the posts of other users
php artisan canvas:user editor --email {email}

// Somebody who can do everything and see everything
php artisan canvas:user admin --email {email}
```

### Configuration

The base path variable name in `config/canvas.php` changed to be consistent with the newly-added domain variable. 
You'll need to make sure your `.env` file is up to date with the correct variable: `CANVAS_PATH`.

Remove the `auth` line from the `middleware` block in `config/canvas.php`.

Remove the entire `user` block from `config/canvas.php`.
 
### Assets

```

Clear any cached views using the `view:clear` Artisan command:

```bash
php artisan view:clear
```

> **Important:** The `Canvas\Http\Middleware\ViewThrottle` middleware was renamed to `Canvas\Http\Middleware
>\Session`. Update any usages of this class.

> **Important:** The `meta` field for posts will now only support a title, description, and canonical link. The
> `og_*` and `twitter_*` tags were unnecessarily specific, so they were deprecated. If you use those tags in your
> frontend templates, simply update them with the new title and description fields.

```

### Service Provider
